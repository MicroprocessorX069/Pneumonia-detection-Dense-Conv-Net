# Pneumonia-detection-Dense-Conv-Net
Pneumonia Detection using Chest XRay Classification

## About:
This is a pytorch implementation of classification of chest X-rays as infected with pneumonia or not. This is examined by radiologists manually for air cavities and lumps. The model also outputs a heat map indicating the areas in the xray dominant in leading to the prediction.
The paper [CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05225)] was published in Dec 2017 by Pranav Rajpurkar and Jeremy Irvin.

## Broader look out:
The 121 layered convolutional neural network has acheived the state of the art detection of pneumonia over manual detection by human radiologist, compared by F1 scores. It uses a dataset of 100000 Chest X-rays 14 dataset annotated by four radiologists.

```

#### Train/ test
1. Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MicroprocessorX069/Generalized-pix2pix-GAN-API.git
$ cd Generalized-pix2pix-GAN-API
```
3. Train
(i) Train
```
$ python python train.py --root_dir "./" --version "1.0" --batch_size 64 --input_width 32 --input_height 32 
```
(ii) Test
'''
$ python python test.py --root_dir "./" --version "1.0" 
'''
4. Enjoy the results
```
$ cd output/epoch
or
$ cd report
```

#### Using a pretrained model weights
Download the model weights as .ckpt file in "./model/" and hit the same commands to train and test with the correct root directory.
